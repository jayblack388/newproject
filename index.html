       <p> I grew up in Bozeman, Montana, so I have a deep appreciation for nature. 
           I grew up hiking, fly fishing, horseback riding, skiing and snowboarding.
        </p>

        <p> I moved to Oregon when I was 10, so when people ask me where I'm from, I still say Oregon.
            I have family members in MN, and moved here for college. Then I stayed for grad school. 
            And I'm still here! In college I majored in Pre-med studies and Anthropology.
            My master's degree in is Medical Device Innovation. I am currently patenting my first medical device.
            I still plan to attend medical school, and hope to create medical devices as well.
        </p>

        <p> I love traveling, learning languages, volunteering, and am passionate about racial justice issues,
            supporting women and minorities in business, being an ally to the LGBT community, and entrepreneurship overall.
        </p>

        <p> I've been sky diving. I'm left handed and ambiextrous in sports. I make really good chocolate chip cookies. :)
